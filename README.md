I made a responsive site using HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
It consists of three pages including Home Page, Menu Page and Menu Category Page.

Header: In full Screen mode it shows the logo of Restaurant which changes it's size as the size of screen changes with a certification on the left hand size and 3 icons of Menu,           About and Awards the it has a calling number on clicking there you get directed to your calling app with number dialled so that you can directly call with a message of             "* We Deliver" which changes to a collapsable navbar having four tabs to go to Home , Menu, About or Awards portion and the call option covers the entire width of the             page.

Footer: The footer consists of the details of the dummy restaurant site like opening closing hours, address ,delivery conditions and copyright.

1) Home Page : It consists of a picture of the restaurant followed by three sections : Menu which directs you to the Menu page, Specials which directs you to the special category                page and the Google Maps which directs you to the hotel location.

2) Menu Page : It consists of various categories of dishes which you can order along with their picutes to add more temptations and increase the orders.

3) Specials : It consists of Special food of the restaurant along with it's pictures to give a view of how they serve the food along with it's price according to quantity and a                 small description of the dish. 

The layout is made using BOOTSTRAP4 functionalities. For icons I have used glyphicons again from bootstrap .
All the pictures are from open source sites.
This is my first project in web development.
